I freely admit that this is outrageously geeky.  A conversation with folks on twitter led to attempts to try and describe, visually, polyamorous relationships.  We kept finding ourselves annotating the links between us, notably with each end of the link, and adding other types of relationships, not all formal or even romantic.  This is simply the standard FDL example, with info added about relationship meaning when you hover over the relationship link itself.
